experiment version 1 = first set of 120 words designed on the ANOVA system
experiment version 2 = second set of words designed on the ANOVA system
experiment version 3 = new set of words to test index versus rest of fingers
experiment version 4 = first set of 120 words (v1) that were typed first
experiment version 5 = all of J&C words with random selection for 60 each, along with typing question (how well you type)

The first three experiments were just different words but the same methods, so let's combine them together.
Experiment 4 and 5 were mostly the same with new words and the typing thing. 

So let's do:
Exp 1 = just replication of previous work plus expertise 
Exp 2 = try activating more of the embodied blah by adding the typing task

Comparison datasets:
- the whole thing together of overlapping words - but he said don't do that 
- afinn
- anew
- dodds
- ferstl
- warriner

which ones should we take out? I'm thinking we are adding new stuff by doing the finger switching, so i was going to analyze all of them, and we can sort out which to exclude if important.

Analyses:
Exp 1: 
- MLM
- control: letter frequency
- main effects: real_fake, rha, finger switch, LR switch, speed/expertise
- interactions: all the above
- DV: rating
- nesting: ID and word

we left out word length because of it's correlation wth finger/LR switch

Exp 2:
same analyses to see if typing affects it? 
we just had them type it, didn't really have a variable for it

Comparison data:
- Regression
- control: letter frequency
- main effects: rha, finger switch, LR switch
- interactions: all above
- DV: rating
